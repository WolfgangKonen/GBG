/**
 * Each class implementing interface GameBoard has the board game GUI. 
 * It shows board game states, optionally the values of possible next actions,
 * and allows user interactions with the board to enter legal moves during 
 * game play or to enter board positions for which the agent reaction is 
 * inspected. 
 * <p>
 * {@link GameBoard} has an internal object derived from {@link StateObservation} which represents the 
 * current game state. This game state can be set (setStateObs()), retrieved (getStateObs()),
 * reset-retrieved ({@link #getDefaultStartState(Random)}), or a random start state can be retrieved
 * with {@link #chooseStartState()} or {@link #chooseStartState(PlayAgent)}.
 * <p>
 * {@link GameBoard} has a reference to an object derived from {@link Arena} which allows access to
 * {@link Arena}-specific settings (which players, params, ...)
